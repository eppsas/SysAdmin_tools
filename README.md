SysAdmin_tools

I am not a professional coder, nor do I have aspirations in that vein. I am a *nix SysAdmin who uses Perl constantly, and
decided I want to try to give something back to the community, even if it is just the friends I have worked with over the
years.

The code in this respository is none of the following:

1) clean

2) clever

3) concise

I hope the code chunks in here will be useful. They are designed to be maintainable by pretty much anyone with the ability 
to read, use Google or some other search engine to find help docs, and a modicum of logic.

If you see something that you want to improve on, please do so.

To be honest the purpose for this repository is mostly for my own use, so I quit leaving useful code at home on the thumb
drive when I need it at work...sigh

All works in this GitHub repository are copywrited and copylefted:
